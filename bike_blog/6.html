<p>So over 2 years and about 3,000 miles on my bike, I have snapped 2
different chains, about 6 times total. I have no idea why this keeps
happening. Let me explain some background</p>
<p>So I bought my first road bike off craigslist for $275. I had no idea
about bikes back then, I did not even know the difference between a road
bike and a hybrid bike back then but it turns out I made a good decision
because I like riding road bikes now. Anyway about a year after I had
started riding my bike my chain snapped. This was not the first time my
chain snapped, so I was ready to repair it. I had a chain breaker and
extra quick links from my last fix. (my chain broke the first time
because an outside link was not pushed in all the way on, only half way
onto the roller. I knew this did not look right when I bought the bike
but I thought that was OK until it broke)</p>
<p>So when it snapped, I limped back home from wherever I was biking at
the time and inspected my chain. What I saw perplexed me. Here is two
photos <img src="../assets/6/broke_chain_1.jpg" alt="broke chain 1" />
<img src="../assets/6/broke_chain_2.jpg" alt="broke chain 2" /></p>
<p>Well after replacing the link with a quick link, I wondered if it was
a fluke. I decided to continue riding and if it happened again, maybe it
was a fluke still, but if it happened a third time, I would get a new
chain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was I too strong and I tore the chain from its links?</li>
<li>Was the chain getting old and worn?</li>
<li>Did the chain have a defect?</li>
<li>Was the chain’s metal structure degraded somehow?</li>
<li>Was the chain rusted?</li>
<li>Is the chain just a bad quality chain?</li>
<li>Could my choice of chain lube be detrimental to it</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="am-i-too-strong">Am I Too Strong</h2>
<p>This can be debunked easily. No I am not strong. Yes when I broke
these links I was putting some stand up power down, but I dont think I
had put more than 500 watts into the chain because I was not strong
enough back then</p>
<h2 id="was-the-chain-oldworn">Was the chain old/worn</h2>
<p>No it was not. I took multiple measurements with my chain checker and
it was not showing anywhere greater than .75 wear which is the
recommended change elongation for 8 speed chains. I dont think the chain
is old either, It is a Sram 850 and they still make those now, I guess
that does not mean the chin was not old because SRAM could have made
those chains for 20 years for all I know. But anyway this will be
debunked later (keep reading lol)</p>
<h2 id="did-the-chain-have-a-defect">Did the chain have a defect</h2>
<p>I dont think the chain had a defect, this will be debunked later as
well.</p>
<h2 id="was-the-chains-metal-surface-degraded-somehow">Was the chain’s
metal surface degraded somehow</h2>
<p>I am unsure how to inspect a chain to know if the metal latuce has
changed since it was new, or even how to compare them, so maybe? I
actually asked a Seattle bike discord channel wisdom to see if any of
them had any ideas. The only thing I really heard from one of those
people is that the metal in the chain can be degraded if you use acidic
bike cleaners. I thought about it and I did use vinegar and water spray
to clean my bike, so this could be a thing</p>
<h2 id="was-the-chain-rusted">Was the chain rusted</h2>
<p>Maybe the chain was a little rusted here or there but I think a chain
is meant to hold up to rust. Also it did not always break where a link
touched a roller, sometimes it broke in the middle of a link</p>
<h2 id="is-the-chain-just-a-bad-quality-chain">Is the chain just a bad
quality chain</h2>
<p>I dont think it is a bad quality chain. The chain currently retails
for $19 on SRAM’s website and an equivalent KMC basic 8 speed chain cost
$20, so that seems like the usual cost for those chains, so it is
probably not a bad chain. As well, on SRAM’s website for this chain, the
marketing description starts with the words “Extremely strong”. Insert
facepalm emoji here lol.</p>
<h2 id="choice-of-chain-lube">Choice of chain lube</h2>
<p>When I started road biking I was using some walmart oil based chain
lube. When people on group rides started talking about was being a
miracle lube, I finally took the opportunity to try it. I was using wax
based chain lube for a few months before the chain broke. Could the
years of oil based have messed with it? Turn out no, I debunk that
later</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-next">What to do next</h2>
<p>So the next month, it happened a second time, and a week later it
happened a third time. So I bought a new chain. I got the chain from
Walmart because I was there for some groceries and stopped by the bike
section to see if there were cheep chains and there was. I forgot how
much it cost though.</p>
<p>So after riding the new chain for about 1000 miles or like 6 months,
guess what happened? It broke, in the same way that the other one broke,
on an outside link. It actually broke 3 times in total. Sometimes it
would break by a roller, and sometimes it just breaks down the middle of
the link where the break did not even touch a roller. I started to get
mad</p>
<p>Once I got the new chain, I changed from cleaning my bike with
vinegar and water to just using water so hopefully the new chain does
not change its internal metal laticue structure because of the acid. We
can rule out that the chain just wears and/or gets old because this
chain did not have much use out of it. We can rule out the chain having
a defect because it is unlikely that two chains from different
manufacturers will both have a quality issue. I checked the new chain
and I also did not see any rust or corrosion in it either. We can also
rule out oil based lube because all the miles on this new chain were
with muck off dry lube (wax based).</p>
<h2 id="new-chain-v3">New chain v3</h2>
<p>I had no choice then but to get a new chain, my third chain in 3,000
miles! I chose to get a KMC X8 for $20. I think this chain had in its
marketing material that it is strong too because it has extra material
in its outside links in a shape of an x to x out fatigue stress lol.</p>
<p>After putting about 500 miles on the chain, it seems to be fine, but
500 miles is not a lot. I am currently using this bike as my indoor
trainer bike and I put about 400 indoor trainer chain equivalent miles
on it since then. I guess I will post a blog in the future if the chain
breaks and let you know what I decided to do about it. Maybe that means
it is time to try to change the drivetrain? Yay I can finally upgrade to
a 1x10 from the 3x8</p>
