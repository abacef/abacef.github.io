<p>Here are some of my controversial opinions of bike components as of
May 2025</p>
<ul>
<li>carbon rim &lt; hydro disc &lt; metal rim &lt; mechanical disc</li>
<li>electronic shifting &lt; cable index shifting = friction
shifting</li>
<li>tubeless &lt; butyl &lt; TPU</li>
<li>Press fit BB &lt; Threaded BB (T47/BSA)</li>
<li>172.5 &lt; 170 &lt; 165mm</li>
<li>2x &lt; 3x &lt; 1x</li>
<li>40cm &lt; 38cm &lt; 36cm</li>
<li>round bottles &lt; aero bottls (whose cage can accommodate round
bottles too)</li>
<li>high stem &lt; low stem</li>
<li>no bento box</li>
<li>no saddle bag</li>
<li>maybe a hydro backpack for endurance rides</li>
<li>C02 &lt; Hand pump</li>
<li>GP5ks &lt; Gator Hardshells</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="break-type">Break type</h2>
<p>I have only used mechanical rim breaks and hydraulic disc breaks on a
bike. It is kind of cool to have the immediate and strong stopping power
of the hydro discs, but to be honest I am not a bike racer and in my
full year of riding 3,500 miles on them, I dont feel like I have ever
used them to their full potential. Also the whole ethos of a road bike
does not seem right to have some toxic fluid in a tube inside a tube in
your bike, then you have to dispose of it, and bleasing breaks is not
the easiest thing to do in the world. The reason why I put metal rim
above hydro disc is because disc breaks still experience break fade when
they get hot, they still perform less well in the wet, actually worse
compared to steel rims in my experience. I put mechanical disc at the
top because you can fit wider tires without having to change your rim
break calipers, the only limit to how wide your tires can be is the
frame.</p>
<h2 id="shifting">Shifting</h2>
<p>I have only used cable index shifting on a bike. Electronic shifting
has the issue that the code and mechanical schematics are not open
source, I am afraid of vendor lock-in and bugs in the code and hacks and
bluetooth jamming. Also I have known many people who have weird things
go on with the shifter batteries, either not holding a charge or just
stopping in the middle of a ride. If I was just getting into biking
right now and dont have the experience of changing cables already and
having the experience of re-indexing both the front and the rear
derailler, maybe you can just skip the cables, but I have no issue
messing around with cables. Also I dont race so I dont have to worry
about a millisecond of shift time lost loosing me a race. For friction
shifting, I dont see an issue with it, you can just dial in the index
yourself, it is a lot slower and more of a pain, but I dont expect it to
get on my nerves at all.</p>
<h2 id="tire-air-holder-mechanism">Tire air holder mechanism</h2>
<p>Tubeless takes a lot of skill to figure out though it has gotten
easier over the years. Yes you can run lower pressures but I dont have
any issues with the feeling of my Gator Hardshells at 90 PSI. I have
never tried for example 32mm tubeless tires though so I may be persuaded
afterwards. TPU is a lot lighter than butyl and it is as light if not
lighter than tubeless. TPU has a measurable amount less rolling
resistance than butyl, but probably a slight more than tubeless. Yes you
can corner faster with high volume low pressure tires but I never had a
problem with cornering a little slower since I dont race. Pinch flats
are a thing with tubes but it should be fine as long as you pump to 90
PSI before every ride. I have only used TPU inner tubes for a week at
this point so I will update you later on my experience.</p>
<h2 id="bb-standards">BB standards</h2>
<p>People say press fit is harder to build tolerances for which leads to
weird BB noises. It is easier to manufacture threads into a metal insert
in your bike frame. Press fit can be lighter which can be faster but I
dont worry about these such marginal gains. I also like the idea that I
need less tools to service a threaded BB at home than a press fit one. I
have not thought about the difference between T47 and BSA though, T47 is
just a larger hole.</p>
<h2 id="crank-length">Crank length</h2>
<p>I have two bikes, one with 170 and one with 172.5. I feel like I can
feel the difference and the 170s are just more pleasant to use, I feel
like there is less effort mentally I am putting into the pedals. Also I
remember when I got my new bike last year with the 172.5 cranks I had a
little hip ache for a couple weeks, that could have been from the
sharper hip angle I had to get used to or it could have been another
aspect of the different bike fit. Also you have less chance of pedal
strikes with shorter cranks, but I am not a racer so I dont usually need
to cornner that aggressively.</p>
<h2 id="chainring-count">Chainring count</h2>
<p>So one of my bikes is an old 3x and one is a 2x. when I started on
the 3x it was really intuitive because when you are on flat roads you
stay in the middle chainring, when it gets steep, your first shift is to
shift to the small chainring and that should give you a sufficient jump
to start the hill, and the opposite for the large chainring. For the 2x
on my new bike, I get really confused all the time when I should be in
what chainring and I end up shifting slower because of that mental
effort. Also the gap between the small and large ring is a lot so
shifting the chainring for example to the big ring, I almost always have
to immediately follow it up with shifting 3 easier cassette gears, and
the opposite for the other direction too which is too much physical
effort in my opinion too.</p>
<p>I really like the concept of 1x because as a minimalist, I get it.
Also I very rarely feel like I need a gear inbetween some gears I have
now, so with the larger gear jumps for the 1x I dont know if it will be
too large or not, but I think even if I do feel like I dont have the
right gear, all the other simplification and thoughtless shifting will
more than overcome that hardship</p>
<h2 id="handlebar-width">Handlebar width</h2>
<p>One of my bikes has a 38 with angled in hoods, and the other bike has
a 42 with straight hoods. I had no issues with the 38 for all my 2 years
of riding it. I do have issues with the 42 though, it is way too wide, I
feel like I am driving a tractor</p>
<h2 id="arrow-bottles">Arrow bottles?</h2>
<p>So my riding style has my knees going in a small bit from the width
of my feet and sometimes my calf brushed against a round bottle (also
the same reason why I dont like bento boxes). I have not used aero
bottle cages yet but I feel like I wont brush as much on them. Also they
are more arrow. I am fine with arrow bottle cages as long as I can put a
round bottle in the same cage in a pinch though, because round bottles
are not going away</p>
<h2 id="handlebar-height">Handlebar height</h2>
<p>When I got my bike it came with some spacers. I did not have any back
pain for the first 1000 miles so I figured I would put those spacers on
the top instead and lower my bars. I did not feel much difference after
I did. People say even though you are getting lower you are less arrow
but that probably only really matters if your hands are close together
like in a TT position so your low hands do not break wind on the side of
your pelvis compared to your fat belly, maybe it depends on your body
proportions?</p>
<h2 id="bento-box">Bento box?</h2>
<p>So I tried a bento box but my knees would always hit it and it
scraped my frame quite a bit and it gives a high center of gravity. No
thank you.</p>
<h2 id="saddle-bag">Saddle bag?</h2>
<p>I used a saddle bag for like 6 months but then it got ripped so the
strap broke and water started getting in which was not nice if I am
counting on it to keep my phone dry. I probably had bad luck but I never
had issues tying my tools together and putting it in my back pocket, I
always had room</p>
<h2 id="hydro-backpack">Hydro backpack</h2>
<p>I would consider this for endurance rides. It seems to be having a
comeback in fassion for long non-team rides like Unbound. I would
consider testing one out for century+ rides since I have to stop for
water alot if not</p>
<h2 id="tire-inflation-on-the-road">Tire Inflation on the road</h2>
<p>People like C02 because it is light but I never had an issue with the
heavyness or the dimensions or the feeling of a hand pump in my back
pocket. I also dont mind using the pump to pump my tires up, in my
opinion it is actually easier to use.</p>
<h2 id="tire-models">Tire models</h2>
<p>I like Gator Hardshells, I have written a previous blog post about
that, but long story short I dont mind the higher rolling resistance and
they are really soft over rough road. GP5ks are currently $190 for a
pair, and they were like $140 just a year ago because I think I remember
checking. Gator Hardshells are only $100 for a pair. The low rolling
resistance of the GP5ks are not worth the money for me as a
non-racer.</p>
