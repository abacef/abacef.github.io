<p>Maxing out your carb intake makes you a better cyclist and reduces
fatigue during and after your ride. I always aim for 90g per hour. Gels
should not be expensive. Make your own!</p>
<p>Cost: $0.15 per 100 g carbs ($7 per 10lb bag sugar) Prep time: 30s
Cook time: 2 min</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups granulated sugar (400g)</li>
</ul>
<p>Process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Put the sugar into a pan on the stove</li>
<li>Add 1 cup water</li>
<li>Stir the mixture a little</li>
<li>Turn the burner on high</li>
<li>Keep stirring gently with a spoon until the spoon no longer attracts
visible granules of sugar (see the pictures below) about 1.5
minutes</li>
<li>Leave the gel out to cool or put it in a refrigeratoe</li>
<li>Put in some sort of container. I currently use a corn syrup bottle
(holds all 400g) and put it in my back pocket</li>
</ol>
